# Unity-UI-Layout
A set of Framer X-esque elements and tools for Unity 2018.3+.  Probably works on some earlier versions but I haven't tested it and don't plan to.


## Elements
### Frame
Does nothing at the moment other than allow for stack rearranging.
**Frame Features included**
- Creation menu


### Stack
Basically just an easier-to-understand (and slightly dumbed down) version of Unity's linear Layout Group components.

**Stack Features included**
- Horizontal and vertical stacks
- Types of spacing, such as Start, Center, End, Space Between, Space Around, and Even Spacing
- Types of alignment, such as Left (Top), Center, and Right (Bottom)
- Padding
- Creation menu
- Ability to reorder with inspector or drag and drop
- Custom inspector with likely everything you'll need to use Stacks
